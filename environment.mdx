## Overview
In our knowledge graph service, an Environment acts as a logical container that isolates sources within a user's workspace. This allows users to create and manage multiple knowledge graphs independently under the same account.

Each environment provides powerful AI-driven search capabilities through our **Intelligent Search** system, enabling natural language queries, automatic analytical operations, and sophisticated graph traversal.

## Why Use Environments?
AI agents often interact with diverse and unrelated sets of information. Environments provide a clean way to separate these contexts, ensuring that data from one use case or project does not interfere with another. This is especially useful when:

- **Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs**: Separate financial data from customer support conversations
- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: Isolate data between different clients or organizations  
- **Specialized AI Agents**: Create focused contexts for specific agent capabilities
- **Development vs Production**: Maintain separate environments for testing and live data
- **Compliance and Security**: Ensure sensitive data remains isolated from general datasets

## Key Characteristics
- **Data Isolation**: Sources stored in one environment are not accessible from another, guaranteeing clean separation of information
- **Scoped Operations**: All search, extraction, and graph operations are performed within the context of a specific environment
- **AI-Powered Search**: Each environment includes intelligent search capabilities with natural language understanding
- **Flexible Architecture**: Create unlimited environments for fine-grained control over your knowledge graphs
- **Multi-Modal Search**: Support for vector search, graph traversal, type-aware queries, and analytical operations

## Structure
Each environment has the following properties:

| Field         | Type   | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string | Unique name of the environment (required)         |
| `description` | string | Optional description providing context or purpose |

<Warning>
Environment names must be unique across all of a user's environments. Attempting to create another environment with the same name will result in an error.
</Warning>

## Relationship with Sources
Every source must be associated with exactly one environment. This ensures that all knowledge derived from a source is scoped correctly and remains isolated within its intended graph.

### Supported Source Types
- **Conversations**: Chat messages, dialogues, and communication threads
- **Business Data**: JSON datasets, customer records, financial data
- **Files**: PDF documents, structured data files  
- **NetworkX Graphs**: Direct graph imports for complex relationship data

## Search and Analytics Capabilities

Each environment provides advanced search functionality:

```python
from praxos_python import SyncClient

client = SyncClient(api_key="prx_your_api_key_here")
env = client.get_environment(name="financial_analysis")

# Natural language queries with AI analysis
results = env.intelligent_search("What are the highest risk transactions this quarter?")

# Automatic analytical operations  
results = env.intelligent_search("Calculate average deal size by customer tier")

# Graph-aware relationship queries
results = env.intelligent_search("Find all entities connected to suspicious accounts")
```

## Example Use Cases

### Financial Services Environment
```python
# Create specialized environment for financial data
financial_env = client.create_environment(
    name="financial_compliance",
    description="Financial transactions and compliance monitoring"
)

# Query with domain-specific intelligence
suspicious_transactions = financial_env.intelligent_search(
    "Find transactions above $10k with high risk indicators"
)
```

### Customer Support Environment  
```python
# Separate environment for customer interactions
support_env = client.create_environment(
    name="customer_support", 
    description="Customer conversations and issue tracking"
)

# Analyze support patterns
issue_analysis = support_env.intelligent_search(
    "What are the most common customer complaints this month?"
)
```
