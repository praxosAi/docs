## Overview
In our knowledge graph service, an Environment acts as a logical container that isolates sources within a user's workspace. This allows users to create and manage multiple knowledge graphs independently under the same account.

## Why Use Environments?
AI agents often interact with diverse and unrelated sets of information. Environments provide a clean way to separate these contexts, ensuring that data from one use case or project does not interfere with another. This is especially useful when:
- Building independent knowledge graphs for different agents or domains
- Running isolated queries and evaluations
- Managing context-specific memory for AI workflows

## Key Characteristics
- Isolation: Sources stored in one environment are not accessible from another. This guarantees clean separation of information.
- Scoped Queries: All graph operations and queries are performed within the context of a specific environment.
- Flexibility: Users can create as many environments as needed, allowing for fine-grained control over their memory architecture.

## Structure
Each environment has the following properties:

| Field         | Type   | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string | Unique name of the environment (required)         |
| `description` | string | Optional description providing context or purpose |

<Warning>
Environment names must be unique across all of a user's environments. Attempting to create another environment with the same name will result in an error.
</Warning>

## Relationship with Sources
Every source must be associated with exactly one environment. This ensures that all knowledge derived from a source is scoped correctly and remains isolated within its intended graph.
