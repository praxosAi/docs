Certain Praxos APIs require an Interface ID. To obtain your Interface ID, please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Navigate to the results page

Navigate to the 'Tasks' page within the Praxos application. Locate the specific task associated with the desired interface schema. If a task with the appropriate schema does not exist, you can create a new one through the web application. Once you have identified or created the relevant task, proceed to its results page.

## Step 2: Copy the Interface ID

The Interface ID is displayed in the top-right corner of the task results page. Click the copy icon adjacent to the ID to copy it to your clipboard.
