title: 'Praxos Python Client'
description: 'The Praxos Python client provides a synchronous interface for interacting with the Praxos API. This guide will help you get started with the client and show you how to use its main features.'
---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U praxos-python
```

## Getting Started

To start using the Praxos client, you'll need to initialize it with your [API key](../api-key):

```python
from praxos_python import SyncClient

client = SyncClient(api_key="your-api-key")
```

### Configuration Options

The client accepts several configuration options:

- `api_key` (required): Your Praxos API key
- `base_url` (optional): Custom base URL for the API
- `params` (optional): Additional query parameters to include in all requests
- `timeout` (optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 10.0)

## Environment Management

### Creating an Environment

```python
# Create a new environment
environment = client.create_environment(name="my-environment")
```

### Retrieving Environments

```python
# Get all environments
environments = client.get_environments()

# Get a specific environment by ID
environment = client.get_environment(environment_id="env-123")

# Get a specific environment by name
environment = client.get_environment(environment_name="my-environment")
```

## Error Handling

The client includes built-in error handling for common API issues:

- `APIError`: General API errors
- `APIKeyInvalidError`: Invalid API key errors

Example error handling:

```python
from praxos_python.exceptions import APIError, APIKeyInvalidError

try:
    environment = client.create_environment(name="my-environment")
except APIKeyInvalidError:
    print("Invalid API key")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e.message}")
```

## Resource Management

The client implements Python's context manager protocol, allowing you to use it with the `with` statement:

```python
with SyncClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
    environment = client.create_environment(name="my-environment")
    # Client will be automatically closed when exiting the context
```
