title: 'Praxos Python Client'
description: 'The Praxos Python client provides a synchronous interface for interacting with the Praxos API. This guide will help you get started with the client and show you how to use its main features.'
---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U praxos-python
```

## Getting Started

To start using the Praxos client, you'll need to initialize it with your [API key](../api-key):

```python
from praxos_python import SyncClient

client = SyncClient(api_key="your-api-key")
```

### Configuration Options

The client accepts several configuration options:

- `api_key` (required): Your Praxos API key
- `base_url` (optional): Custom base URL for the API
- `params` (optional): Additional query parameters to include in all requests
- `timeout` (optional): Request timeout in seconds (default: 10.0)

## Environment Management

### Creating an Environment

```python
# Create a new environment
environment = client.create_environment(name="my-environment")

# Create an environment with description and ontologies
environment = client.create_environment(
    name="my-environment",
    description="Environment for processing customer data",
    ontologies=["customer-ontology-id"]  # List of ontology IDs or SyncOntology objects
)
```

### Retrieving Environments

```python
# Get all environments
environments = client.get_environments()

# Get a specific environment by ID
environment = client.get_environment(id="env-123")

# Get a specific environment by name
environment = client.get_environment(name="my-environment")
```

## Ontology Management

Ontologies define the structure and types of data that your environment can process. They use Pydantic models to define schemas for entity extraction and validation.

### Creating an Ontology

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

# Define your data schemas using Pydantic models
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Full name of the person")
    age: Optional[int] = Field(description="Age in years")
    email: Optional[str] = Field(description="Email address")

class Organization(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Organization name")
    industry: Optional[str] = Field(description="Industry sector")
    employees: Optional[int] = Field(description="Number of employees")

# Create an ontology with multiple schemas
ontology = client.create_ontology(
    name="business-ontology",
    description="Ontology for business entities",
    schemas=[Person, Organization]
)
```

### Retrieving Ontologies

```python
# Get all ontologies
ontologies = client.get_ontologies()

# Get a specific ontology by ID
ontology = client.get_ontology(id="onto-123")

# Get a specific ontology by name
ontology = client.get_ontology(name="business-ontology")
```

## Error Handling

The client includes built-in error handling for common API issues:

- `APIError`: General API errors
- `APIKeyInvalidError`: Invalid API key errors

Example error handling:

```python
from praxos_python.exceptions import APIError, APIKeyInvalidError

try:
    environment = client.create_environment(name="my-environment")
except APIKeyInvalidError:
    print("Invalid API key")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e.message}")
```

## Additional Imports

The SDK provides several model classes and utilities that you can import:

```python
from praxos_python import (
    SyncClient,
    SyncEnvironment, 
    SyncSource,
    SyncOntology,
    APIError
)

# For message handling in conversations
from praxos_python.types import Message

# For search result handling
from praxos_python.models import Context
```

## Resource Management

The client implements Python's context manager protocol, allowing you to use it with the `with` statement:

```python
with SyncClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
    environment = client.create_environment(name="my-environment")
    # Client will be automatically closed when exiting the context
```
