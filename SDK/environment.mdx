description: Learn how to work with Environments in the Praxos Python SDK
---

The Environment class is a core component of the Praxos Python SDK that allows you to manage and interact with your Praxos environments.

An Environment represents a container for your sources and provides methods to interact with them. It's the main entry point for working with your data in Praxos.

## Creating an Environment

```python
from praxos_python import PraxosClient

with PraxosClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
    environment = client.create_environment(name="environment name")
```
For more detail see [Client doc](/client).

## Obtain an Environment

```python
from praxos_python import PraxosClient

with PraxosClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
    environment = client.get_environment(environment_id="your-environment-id")
```
For more detail see [Client doc](/client).

## Methods

### Get Context

Retrieve relevant context for an LLM based on a query.

```python
context = environment.get_context(
    query="What is the main topic?",
    top_k=1  # Optional: number of context items to return
)
```

### Add Sources

#### Add a Conversation

Add a conversation source to your environment.

```python
from praxos_python.types.message import Message

messages = [
    Message(role="user", content="Hello"),
    Message(role="assistant", content="Hi there!")
]

source = environment.add_conversation(
    messages=messages,
    source_name="My Conversation",  # Optional
    description="A sample conversation"  # Optional
)
```

#### Add a File

Add a file source to your environment. Supported file types include PDF and JSON.

```python
source = environment.add_file(
    file_path="path/to/your/file.pdf",
    name="My Document",  # Optional
    description="A sample document"  # Optional
)
```

#### Add Business Data

Add structured business data to your environment.

```python
data = {
    "key": "value",
    "nested": {
        "field": "data"
    }
}

source = environment.add_business_data(
    data=data,
    name="My Business Data",  # Optional
    description="Sample business data"  # Optional
)
```

### Retrieve Sources

#### Get All Sources

Retrieve all sources in your environment.

```python
sources = environment.get_sources()
```

#### Get a Specific Source

Retrieve a specific source by ID or name.

```python
# By ID
source = environment.get_source(source_id="your-source-id")

# By name
source = environment.get_source(source_name="My Source")
```

## Error Handling

The SDK includes built-in error handling for common scenarios:

- `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when attempting to add a non-existent file
- `ValueError`: Raised for invalid file extensions or missing required parameters
- `APIError`: Raised for API-related errors
