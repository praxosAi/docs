# Getting Started with Praxos

This quickstart guide will help you integrate and utilize the Praxos effectively. You'll learn how to:

- Configure your development environment
- Initialize the Praxos client
- Create and manage environments
- Add conversations to the knowledge graph
- Retrieve contextual information

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A valid Praxos API key (see [API Key Instructions](/api-key))
- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming

## Environment Setup

1. Install the Praxos Python SDK:

```bash
pip install -U praxos-python
```

2. Configure your API key:

```python
import requests

# Replace with your Praxos API key
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Initialize the Client

Create a Praxos client instance and initialize an environment:

```python
from praxos_python import SyncClient

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = SyncClient(api_key=API_KEY)

# Create a new environment
env = client.create_environment(name="MyEnvironment")
```

To learn more about client please review [this page](SDK/client).

## Add Conversations to Knowledge Graph

Add LLM conversations to the Praxos knowledge graph:

```python
from raxos_python.types.message import Message

messages = [
    Message(role="user", content="Hello, I am using Praxos knowledge graph, and it's awesome."),
    Message(role="assistant", content="Hi there! I'm glad you're exploring Praxos knowledge graph. It's a powerful tool for managing and retrieving contextual information.")
]

source = env.add_conversation(
    messages=messages,
    source_name="My Conversation",  # Optional identifier
    description="A sample conversation"  # Optional description
)
```
To learn more about environment please review [this page](SDK/environment). 

## Monitor Indexing Status

The knowledge graph requires time to index new sources. Indexing duration varies based on source size. Ensure indexing is complete before querying:

```python
import time

# Wait for indexing to complete
while source.get_status() != "success":
    time.sleep(1)
```
More document about source is available [here](SDK/source)

## Retrieve Contextual Information

Query the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant context:

```python
# Query the knowledge graph
context = env.get_context("what is the name of knowledge graph tool?")
print(context.sentence)
```

Example output:
```
a KnowledgeGraphTool, (which is a Tool), (category: Physical), identified as '67B770787F48A6Eac8C8B578 683A42Bb3983E0Bef0E2D031 683A42Bb3983E0Bef0E2D030 0 Tool Praxoskg', which has attribute ToolName 'Praxos knowledge graph' (base: NameType), and has attribute ToolFunctionalityDescription 'powerful tool for managing and retrieving contextual information' (base: DescriptionType). has attribute ToolName 'Praxos knowledge graph' (base: NameType).
```

The retrieved context can be utilized to enhance LLM responses for your specific use case.
